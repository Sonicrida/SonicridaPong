                Welcome to Sonicrida Pong! This is a game I made to get familiar with <a href="http://phaser.io/">Phaser</a>, an awesome javascript game development framework. It was made with the help of a lovely tutorial written by <a href="http://www.antonoffplus.com/coding-an-html5-game-for-30-minutes-or-an-introduction-to-the-phaser-framework/">Edvin Antonov</a>. It's not perfect but it's a working game of pong written completely with javascript. The music is from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN78i0nfqE8">Mario and Luigi: Dream Team</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>How to play:</h3>
            <p>Click to start the game and move your mouse to hit the ball back at the opponent and try to get it past them.</p>
